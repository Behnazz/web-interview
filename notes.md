## How long did it take?

- The project took 3 days to complete. 

## Overview

### Provide an overview of how you approached this challenge

Fisrt I read the instructions and then forked and cloned the code. I made a branch (Behnaz-Branch) and started.
Below are the steps I took:
1. I refactored the code by reading it and found out some codes were unnecessary or needed to be changed.
2. I used stateless function components for the parts I will reuse again like buttons. 
3. Next stage was fetching the data from the server. 
4. I focused on design. I updated css and used flex box.
5. I used different libraries for development like like moment.js, fontAwesome, axios.
6. I started writing test for my code 
7. I used testing-library (https://testing-library.com/ "Testing Library")
8. I made final changes by reviewing my code again
9. In order to check accesibility I used Light House Chrome extension

### Explain any trade-offs you made here, for example if you decided to take less time on the styling so you could concentrate on tests

I think I could have handled errors better.


### Explain what you would have done next, for example you might decide to write more tests or spend more time on styling

I would have write more tests and handle errors.
